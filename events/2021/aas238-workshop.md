> AAS WorldWide Telescope (WWT) is a free and open-source data visualization
> tool that runs right in your web browser. Use WWT inside Jupyter to explore
> imagery and data tables on the sky, or embed it on other websites to share
> your data with your colleagues, students, and the general public in a slick,
> intuitive interface. This interactive tutorial will introduce attendees to the
> WWT tool and its software ecosystem in the context of its applications to
> research, education, and broader impacts.

No prior WWT experience is necessary! Nor is any software installation â€” all
activities will use cloud-based services. All you need is a laptop.
