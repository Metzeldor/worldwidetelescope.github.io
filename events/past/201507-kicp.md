# Archived Event: 2015 KICP Workshop

## Chicago, IL, USA; 2015 July 28

*Hosted at the
 [Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics](https://kicp.uchicago.edu/).*

*Main event website: <https://kicp-workshops.uchicago.edu/wwt2015/>.*

This will be an intensive 1-day working workshop for people who are interested
in porting their data into WorldWide Telescope and developing uses for that
data in WWT - video abstracts, tours, etc. A follow-up data showcase at the
Adler Planetarium is also planned for September 24, 2015.

Please contact us at wwt2015@cosmo.uchicago.edu if you are interested in
participating.

A lunch talk will provide the larger KICP community with a broad introduction
to WWT and ways that its stunning visuals can be used for outreach, teaching,
professional talks, publications and research.
