# WWT 2022

The 2022 edition of AAS WorldWide Telescope will be released on February
15th, 2022. To learn more about what WWT is, visit [the WWT homepage][wwthome].
An “edition” is a coordinated release of the many software and data components
that comprise the WWT ecosystem.

## What’s New

So many things! WWT 2022 wraps up several years’ worth of improvements across
the WWT ecosystem. Highlights include:

- The new WWT JupyterLab “research app” for seamlessly integrated data analysis and
  visualization
- New support for [HiPS] imagery and catalogs
- A new system for “tiling” [FITS] datasets to allow even gigapixel-scale
  scientific images to be explored interactively ([supported by the NSF][2004840])
- A dramatically expanded suite of data tools for converting all kinds of images
  and datasets into WWT’s formats (partially supported by [Space Telescope
  Science Institute][stsci])
- A new stable release of the WWT Windows application
- Literally thousands of beautiful new astronomy images integrated into WWT’s
  data holdings
- And more!

## See WWT 2022 In Action

Here are some great ways to see what WWT 2022 can do:

- For researchers and other technical experts, you can dive right into [our
  cloud-based tutorial notebooks][mybinder]{:target="_blank"} that demonstrate the usage of the
  new WWT JupyterLab app.
- [Click here][meerkat-gc]{:target="_blank"} to open up a freestanding version
  of the app to showcase an incredible image of the Milky Way galactic center at
  radio wavelengths from the MeerKAT telescope ([details
  here][meerkat-deets]{:target="_blank"})
- The [Solar System Explorer][sse]{:target="_blank"} is a WWT-powered
  educational web application created by the [WWT
  Ambassadors][wwta]{:target="_blank"} group. It didn’t take a team of software
  engineers to create this — just a pair of astronomer/educators with a keen eye
  for design and willingness to learn a bit of JavaScript!
- [This *Sky & Telescope* article][sandt-nye]{:target="_blank"} embeds a
  WWT-powered “guided tour” to provide a scripted, but interactive, tour of the
  some bright stars in the northern winter night sky.

## How to Get It

There’s no one way to install WWT because the software spans so many different
uses.
