> AAS WorldWide Telescope (WWT) is the American Astronomical Society’s official
> tool for visually exploring humanity’s scientific understanding of the
> Universe. This free and open-source software package can power everything from
> interactive "live" images in journal articles, to exploratory data
> visualizations in Jupyter notebooks, to immersive custom websites, to
> professional-grade planetariums. This interactive tutorial will introduce
> attendees to the WWT software ecosystem in the context of its applications to
> research, education, and public outreach.

No prior WWT experience is necessary! Nor is any software installation — all
activities will use cloud-based services. All you need is a laptop with a
charging cable and a recent web browser installed.
