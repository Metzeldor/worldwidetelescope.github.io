# Astronomical Data Visualization in the Age of Science Platforms

Modern surveys like LSST will generate datasets far too large for individual
researchers to download and analyze, ushering in the era of web-based “science
platforms.” Classical astronomy visualization tools aren’t built for the web —
so how are we going to explore our increasingly complex data in this new
paradigm?

This **AAS238 splinter meeting**, sponsored by the [AAS WorldWide
Telescope][WWT] project, will gather survey scientists, science platform
engineers, and visualization tool builders and explore the answers to this
question. The meeting will take place in two sessions on **Monday, June 7**:

- [Session 1][s1] from 12:00–1:30 PM (US Eastern time = UTC - 4)
- [Session 2][s2] from 4:10–5:40 PM

The official AAS238 Slack has a channel for this meeting, which is the
recommended venue for questions and side-channel discussion:

- `#splinter_astronomical_data_visualization_in_the_age_of_science_platforms_i`
- There is also a separate `#..._ii` channel for the second session, but we
  encourage people to use the first channel only to keep the conversation all in
  the same place.

## Breakouts and Next Steps

A major goal of the event is to stimulate the creation of a “needs assessment”
report that will define a vision for the future of astronomical data
visualization and analyze the progress needed to turn that vision into a
reality. This document will help guide the investments that will be necessary to
enable the broad astrophysics community to make the most of the coming age of
science platforms.

At the end of the workshop, attendees will kick off this assessment with a **breakout
discussion period**. The agenda is:

1. First Breakout: What *trends* can we identify from the days’ presentations?
  - Everyone is randomly assigned into breakout rooms
  - Remember your room number!
  - Choose a “reporter” who will report back to the main group
  - Discuss as a group and identify three trends
  - Return from breakout; reporters share their groups’ findings
2. Second Breakout: What *unmet needs* can we identify?
  - Everyone is randomly assigned into breakout rooms
  - Remember your room number!
  - Choose a “reporter” who will report back to the main group
  - Discuss as a group and identify three needs
  - Return from breakout; reporters share their groups’ findings

After the workshop, volunteers will collaborate to formalize these findings into
a brief written report. Indicate your interest in the writing process using [the
