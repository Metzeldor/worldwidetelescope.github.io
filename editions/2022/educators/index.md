# Get Started with WWT 2022: For Educators

If you’re thinking about using WWT in the classroom or other educational
settings, we recommend that you start by exploring WWT’s “guided tours”.

- [Getting Help](#getting-help)


## Get the Software

The first thing to do is to get your hands on the WWT software. Everyone can use
the WWT “web client,” a multimedia application that lets you explore the
universe from the comfort of your own web browser — no installation needed!
Launch it here:

> <https://worldwidetelescope.org/webclient/>

If you or your students use the Windows operating system, you can also download
and install the WWT Windows client here:

> <https://worldwidetelescope.org/download/>

Compared to the web client, the Windows client offers higher performance, a more
sophisticated tour editor, and advanced functionality like support for VR
headsets.


## Explore WWT’s Guided Tours

For most educators, WWT’s [guided tour][tours] functionality is an effective —
and surprisingly easy-to-learn — way to teach astronomy concepts. See example
tours and learn how to create your own at [this
page][wwta-create]{:target="_blank"}, and check out [a suite of educational
materials][wwta-materials] built around WWT-based inquiry. Both of these
resources are maintained by the [WWT Ambassadors][wwta] (WWTA) project, an
effort based at Harvard that uses WWT to transform classroom astronomy
education.

You can explore a whole library of WWT tours through the “Tours” tab of the WWT
web or Windows clients. Along with the WWTA website, the WWT [Tour Authoring
Guide][tag] offers more resources on tour creation.

## Next Steps

If you want to share a tour online, you can use the [WWT Embed Creator
tool][embed] to create a shareable link. For instance, [this *Sky & Telescope*
article][sandt-nye]{:target="_blank"} embeds a WWT tour to provide an
interactive, multimedia tour of the some bright stars in the northern winter
night sky.

If you get really inspired, it’s possible to use WWT to create even more
sophisticated, custom educational experiences. Underlying the WWT web
applications is a reusable toolkit that can be used to create custom
interactives, like these from the WWT Ambassadors program:

- [Solar System Explorer](https://projects.wwtambassadors.org/solar-system-explorer/)
- [Galaxies and the History of the Universe](http://projects.wwtambassadors.org/galaxy-history-universe/)
- [Life Cycle of Stars](https://projects.wwtambassadors.org/star-life-cycle/)

Creating these takes some web development know-how, and a keen eye for design
doesn’t hurt, but WWT takes care of a lot of the hard stuff for you!

You might also want to check out our suggestions [for
planetarians](../planetarians/) if you have access to a planetarium dome for
astronomy education.


## Getting Help

If you run into any issues, we recommend seeking support on the [WWT user
forum][forum] or [contacting the WWT Ambassadors][wwta-contact].
