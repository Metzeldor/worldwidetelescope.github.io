# WWT 2022 Release Notes: Toasty

Toasty is a Python library for processing data into WWT’s formats. It also
provides a command-line tool, `toasty`, supporting common data processing needs.

## Installation & Getting Started

See the [Creators](../creators/) page for information on installing Toasty and
getting started using it.

## Completely Rebuilt for WWT 2022

While the Toasty Python library has been around for a while, it has been
completely rebuilt for WWT 2022. It is now much more flexible, supporting a
variety of image formats such as FITS, OpenEXR, JPEG2000, and more. It now
supports all-sky, planetary, and “study” data formats, and adds the `toasty`
command-line tool. It now supports Windows, too.

## Pipeline Functionality

The WWT 2022 release of Toasty also adds new “pipeline” functionality for
processing large, evolving sets of images. See [the Toasty documentation][pipedocs]
for more information.

developer resources such as code repositories and comprehensive changelogs.
