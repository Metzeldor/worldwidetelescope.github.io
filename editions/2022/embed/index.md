# WWT 2022 Release Notes: Embed and Sharing App

WWT 2022 marks the first release of the WWT “embed” web application, which you
can use to insert WWT imagery and tours into other webpages, the same way you
would for a YouTube video.

The preferred way to use the embed app is via the [WWT Embed
Creator](../embed-creator/) hosted at:

> <https://embed.worldwidetelescope.org/>

The creator app gives simple recipes for standard use cases, such as sharing an
individual image or WWT tour. Certain more esoteric usages can be accomplished
by manually building the web “query string” used to initialize the app. The
supported features are implicitly defined by the
[@wwtelescope/embed-common][wec] TypeScript package.

See the [detailed WWT 2022 components list](../components/) for links to
developer resources such as code repositories and changelogs.
