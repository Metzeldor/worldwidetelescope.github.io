# Get Started with WWT 2022: For Planetarians

One of WWT’s unique features is that it can showcase content across such a wide
range of systems — from your web browser to state-of-the-art multi-channel
domes. Especially in “these unprecedented times,” we hope this makes WWT an
exciting tool for all kinds of planetarians!

## Get the Software

The first thing to do is to get your hands on the WWT software. For planetarium
uses, you’ll want the WWT Windows application:

If you’re new to WWT, have some fun playing around with it and exploring the
interface!

If you already have WWT installed in a “production” environment like a dome or
museum kiosk, we strongly recommend that you **upgrade carefully**. While the
WWT team strives to keep the Windows application functioning as reliably as
possible, the upgrades with WWT 2022 include internal changes to the app (e.g.,
a new default installation directory) that may require updates to existing
setups. *Do not upgrade your production installation without thorough advance
testing. Do your testing in an environment that cannot interfere with your
production systems.* While the WWT team aspires to provide a high level of
service, we provide support on a best-effort basis and cannot guarantee timely
technical assistance.


## Learn About WWT’s Dome Features

If you’re not already familiar with WWT, you should definitely consult the [WWT
Planetarium Guide][pg] to learn more about its support for planetarium domes,
and whether it might be compatible with your setup. Even if you are familiar, it
doesn’t hurt to refresh your memory!

Another great resource is the [WWT Tour Authoring Guide][tag], which describes
how to create scripted WWT “guided tours”. See especially the [Impacts
tutorial][impacts], which includes a series of videos showing the creation of a
production-quality tour.

## Next Steps

The WWT team is excited about the possibilities opened up by pairing the WWT
Windows application with its web-based siblings. Tours that play in the dome can
also play in the web browser, giving a way for your audiences to stay in touch
after they leave the planetarium — and a way for them to get excited about
upcoming events. The [WWT Embed Creator tool][embed] creates shareable links to
tours. For instance, [this *Sky & Telescope*
article][sandt-nye]{:target="_blank"} embeds a WWT tour to provide an
interactive, multimedia tour of the some bright stars in the northern winter
night sky. There are plenty of other ways to leverage WWT’s web capabilities too
— and with a bit of web know-how, your imagination is the limit!
