# WWT Newsletter: May 2019

Dear all,

Thank you for subscribing to the AAS WorldWide Telescope announcements mailing
list! Here are your first, official, Announcements!

## 1. Please help spread the word

We would love to expand the reach of this list to as many WWT users as we can
find. Therefore, I encourage you to forward this message to any folks that you
know who use, or might want to use, WWT. Here's the short link to sign up for
this list:

<https://bit.ly/wwt-signup>

We're especially interested in folks out there who are using WWT in planetariums
â€” we want to be able to stay in touch!

To tease a little bit ... we're going to have a big announcement next week, and
I want to make sure it reaches as many WWTers as it can!

## 2. New Contributor Hub website

I've been updating and consolidating the WWT web presence over the past few
months. I'm proud to announce our new Contributor Hub:

<https://worldwidetelescope.github.io/>

The aspiration is that this will be the central, well, hub, both for seasoned
project contributors and folks interested in getting involved. But there's
definitely room for improvement and clarification in the website design, and
there's always room for more documentation and onboarding materials. Feedback
(or GitHub pull requests) welcome!

## 3. WWT at AAS234 (June 9-13)

The WWT project will be running workshops and tutorials at the AAS234 summer
meeting in St. Louis, MO, USA, on June 9-13. Here's the program of activities:

We hope to see you there! Please direct inquiries to Peter,
