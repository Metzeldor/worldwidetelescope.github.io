# Archived Event: 2015 Developer Workshop

## Multiple sites; 2015 November 7

This WorldWide Telescope (WWT) workshop is intended to help developers and
advanced users who know some coding to learn how to contribute to the
development of the WWT open source code base.

## Logistics

This workshop will take place in three locations connected by video
conferencing: Microsoft Research-Redmond, WA, Microsoft Research-New England
in Cambridge, MA and at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
(NCSA) in Urbana, IL. The workshop staff will primarily be in Redmond, WA and
Cambridge, MA locations. Because the workshops are across three time zones,
will be starting a little early for the Redmond location and finishing later
for the Cambridge location.

### 9:00 am - 6:30 pm (Cambridge, MA)

Note, 9-10 am hour in Cambridge the group will meet to discuss the current
state of WWT. Because of the time difference other locations will not
participate.

## Who is this workshop for?

This workshop is targeted at potential WorldWide Telescope developers. This
workshop will get people up to speed with the WWT eco-system including windows

for people with a variety of developer backgrounds. Below are a few of the
ways you might want to get involved:

- Building data exploration experiences around WWT using LCAPI.
