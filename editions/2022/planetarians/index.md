## Get the Software

The first thing to do is to get your hands on the WWT software. For planetarium
uses, you’ll want the WWT Windows application:

### <https://worldwidetelescope.org/download/>

If you already have WWT installed in a “production” environment like a dome or
museum kiosk, we strongly recommend that you **proceed very carefully**. While
the WWT team strives to keep the Windows application functioning as reliably as
possible, the upgrades with WWT 2022 include internal changes to the app that
may break existing use cases. *Do not install the newest version in production
scenarios without significant advance testing. Do your testing in an environment
that cannot interfere with your production systems.* While the WWT aspires to
provide a high level of service, we provide support on a best-effort basis and
cannot guarantee timely technical assistance.


## Next Steps

The app is just the beginning. We encourage you to [connect with the WWT
community][connect] to stay informed about new data, learn about WWT events, and
share your own creations!

forum][forum], or asking through one of the social media channels listed on the
[Connect][connect] page.
