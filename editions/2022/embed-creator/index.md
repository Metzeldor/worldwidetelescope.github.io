# WWT 2022 Release Notes: Embed Creator App

WWT 2022 marks the first release of the WWT Embed Creator web application, which
helps you insert WWT imagery and tours into other webpages, the same way you
would for a YouTube video. The creator is hosted at:

> <https://embed.worldwidetelescope.org/>

The “embeds” that it creates are powered by [the WWT Embed & Sharing
app](../embed/).

This version of the creator includes recipes for embeds that:

- Showcase a single image
- Play a guided tour
- View a planetary body

See the [detailed WWT 2022 components list](../components/) for links to
developer resources such as code repositories and changelogs.
