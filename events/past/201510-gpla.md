# Archived Event: WWT @ GPLA 2015

## Grand Rapids, MI, USA; 2015 October 16

*Hosted at the
[Great Lakes Planetarium Association 2015 conference](https://glpa.org/proceedingsab2015).*

In this workshop, participants will learn how to use WorldWide Telescope in
their planetarium domes. This includes setup and interface to systems. The
workshop will also go over how to use WWT for the production of real-time
presentation, as well as rending frames for video playback (or to create
specific layers for compositing). All these experiences can be authored on a
standard Windows PC. No special hardware is required but the system can use
wireless Xbox controllers as well as commodity MIDI controllers, which will be
on-hand for demonstration.
