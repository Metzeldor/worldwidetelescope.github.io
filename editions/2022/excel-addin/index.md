# WWT 2022 Release Notes: Excel Add-In

The WWT Excel Add-In has **not** been updated in the WWT 2022 release cycle. At
this stage, it is effectively unmaintained, and is increasingly unlikely to work
for anyone. The WWT team recommends using [pywwt](../pywwt/) for loading data
tables into WWT.

## Installation

If you wish to try your luck, you can still download the add-in [here].

[here]: https://worldwidetelescope.org/download/#excel-addin

Volunteers to help maintain the add-in are welcome. See the [detailed WWT 2022
components list](../components/) for links to developer resources such as the
code repository.
