# Get Started with WWT 2022: For Enthusiasts

If you’re not using WWT in a professional capacity, we recommend using the
classic WWT “client” applications.

## Use the WWT Web Client

The WWT “web client” is a multimedia application that lets you explore the universe
from the comfort of your own web browser! No installation needed. Launch it here:

### <https://worldwidetelescope.org/webclient/>

Navigate the sky, pull up imagery taken by the world’s best telescopes, and
watch guided tours that explain, educate, and entertain!


## Install the Windows Client

If you use the Windows operating system, you can also download and install the
WWT Windows client here:

### <https://worldwidetelescope.org/download/>

Compared to the web client, the Windows client offers higher performance, a more
sophisticated tour editor, and advanced functionality like support for VR
headsets.


## Next Steps

The app is just the beginning. We encourage you to [connect with the WWT
community][connect] to stay informed about new data, learn about WWT events, and
share your own creations!
