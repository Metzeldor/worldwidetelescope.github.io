# “Interactively Visualizing Massive Images and Catalogs in Jupyter with AAS WorldWide Telescope”

## Cape Town, South Africa and online; 2021 October 24–28

We look forward to welcoming attendees to this focus demo! The date of the event
is TBD.

### Abstract

Modern astronomical datasets are, of course, bigger than ever. Not only are they
often too big to fit in most computers’ memories, more and more frequently
they’re too big to even download at all. While the astronomical community has
converged on a big-picture approach to this challenge — the web-based "science
platform" concept — numerous smaller-scale engineering problems still need to be
solved before astronomers will be fully equipped to handle the upcoming data
deluge. In particular, the switch to browser-based UIs creates a need — and an
opportunity — for web-native, interactive data visualization tools. This Focus
Demo will showcase new capabilities that have recently been added to AAS
WorldWide Telescope that empower users to interactively explore catalogs with
billions of rows (using the HiPS progressive standard) and imagery with billions
of pixels (using HiPS and tiled FITS formats). These features are tightly
integrated with JupyterLab to provide one-click startup and dead-simple linkage
with Python notebooks for data analysis. WWT’s efficient WebGL-based rendering
is paired with a suite of user-friendly data-processing tools that make it easy
to prepare data for visualization.
