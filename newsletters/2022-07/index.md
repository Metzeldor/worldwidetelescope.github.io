## JWST in AAS WorldWide Telescope!

Happy northern summer, WWT community!

Today NASA [released the first images][nasa-release] from the JWST infrared
space telescope, and the WWT team is delighted to announce that you can already
start using WWT to explore them in all of their splendid detail! We’re really
proud of the snazzy interactive viewer that we’ve built for you to use on your
computer or mobile phone:

The [WWT webclient][web] has also been updated with all of the new images,
which you can find in a new “JWST” folder in the “Explore” ribbon.

And the [WWT Windows client][win] has been updated too! We’ve just released
[version 6.1.2.0][win], which also includes this new folder. If you already have
WWT for Windows installed, you should be able to “Check for updates“ and get the
new version.

Unfortunately, many people — including many professional astronomers — can’t
wholeheartedly celebrate today’s data release due to the way that NASA has named
its newest flagship telescope. The American Astronomical Society, sponsor of the
WWT project, [is pursuing this issue with NASA][naming-update] through formal
channels. Keeping that in mind, WWT still congratulates everyone who worked so
hard over a span of decades to make JWST a success. We’re looking forward to
many, many more images to come!
