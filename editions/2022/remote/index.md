# WWT 2022 Release Notes: Remote Control

The WWT Remote Control has **not** been updated in the WWT 2022 release cycle.
It is currently unmaintained.

Due to changes in the default installation of [the Windows
client](../winclient/), the remote control may not work WWT 2022. Exercise
caution when upgrading if you need the remote control.

## Installation

You can download the remote control [here].

[here]: https://worldwidetelescope.org/download/#remote-control

Volunteers to help maintain the remote control are welcome. See the [detailed
WWT 2022 components list](../components/) for links to developer resources such
as the code repository.
