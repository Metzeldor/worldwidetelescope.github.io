# Welcome to the AAS WorldWide Telescope Contributor Hub!

<!-- NOTE: these links are inlined because consecutive out-of-band links
 with parentheses don't render well. -->
The [AAS](https://aas.org/)
[WorldWide Telescope](http://www.worldwidetelescope.org) (WWT) is a free,
open-source tool for visually exploring humanity’s scientific understanding of
the Universe. WWT is primarily a website that allows anyone to interactively
explore terabytes of astronomical data in a seamlessly integrated 4D
simulation of the known universe. But the WWT software ecosystem also includes
a Windows application that can power planetariums, a cloud-based web service
for discovering and sharing astronomical data, and a Python module allowing
users to write their own software to control and extend all of these systems.

WWT is brought to you by the non-profit [American Astronomical Society] (AAS)
and the [.NET Foundation]. Established in 1899 and based in Washington, DC,
the AAS is the major organization of professional astronomers in North
America.
