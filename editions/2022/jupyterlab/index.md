# WWT 2022 Release Notes: WWT JupyterLab Extension

WWT 2022 marks the first release of the WWT JupyterLab extension, which connects
[the WWT research app](../research-app/) to the [JupyterLab] computational
environment.

[JupyterLab]: https://jupyter.org/

The JupyterLab extension itself is a relatively small piece of code, since itâ€™s
primarily concerned with allowing Jupyter notebook kernels to communicate with
an instance of the WWT research app.

## Installation & Getting Started

See the [Researchers](../researchers/) page for information about how to install
WWT into a JupyterLab-based environment.

See the [detailed WWT 2022 components list](../components/) for links to
developer resources such as code repositories and detailed changelogs.
