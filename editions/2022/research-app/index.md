# WWT 2022 Release Notes: Research App

WWT 2022 marks the first release of the WWT research web application, which now
powers [pywwt](../pywwt/) and WWT’s JupyterLab support. It offers a modern user
interface for scientific users of WWT.

## Installation & Getting Started

You won’t generally need to install the research app itself. Most users will
encounter the research app through WWT’s JupyterLab support, as described on the
[Researchers](../researchers/) page.

## Embeddability and Scriptability

While most people will use the research app inside JupyterLab, developers can
also script its usage and embed it in other web applications. See [the app
documentation][docs] for more information.

developer resources such as code repositories and comprehensive changelogs.
