This is the hub for all projects that are a part of WorldWide Telescope.

For example, file tickets in this tracker for issues that affect WorldWide Telesecope as a whole, that is, issues that are not specific to any particular code repository.  One obvious example of this is data on the back-end that affects all web and desktop instances of WWT.
