# WWT Newsletter: June 2020

## Pluto Pack, New Homepage, and More

Dear friends,

Welcome to the next installment of the AAS WorldWide Telescope newsletter! It
has been a long time since the previous one, and the world has changed a great
deal in the meantime. I'm sure that I speak on behalf of everyone involved in
the WWT project when I say that we hope that this message finds you and yours in
good health and strong spirits.

Amidst everything, it has been an exciting time for the WWT project, with a
great deal of progress on many fronts! Below you'll find some of the highlights.

Best,

Peter K. G. Williams
Innovation Scientist, American Astronomical Society (AAS)
Director of the AAS WorldWide Telescope Project

### New Content! June 2020 “Pluto Pack” Released

One of the great things about WWT is that you can import new images and data —
including your own data! — any time. Over the coming months, we're going to make
a point of packaging up some fun bundles of new data for you to play with,
whether it's "hot off the presses" astronomical data, great amateur
astrophotography, or a new twist on a golden oldie.

This month, David Weigel of the US Space and Rocket Center (Huntsville, AL) has
produced a fantastic Pluto Pack with enhanced data from the New Horizons
mission.

#### [Check out the Pluto Pack trailer on YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1569bZ3i2UY)

The [Pluto Pack](https://wwt-forum.org/t/pluto-pack-june-2020-content-package-release/142) includes:

- New **Enhanced Color maps of Pluto and Charon**
- **Colorized Terrain** maps of Pluto and Charon showing altimetry
- Not only imagery, but a **3D model of Arrokoth** (2014 MU69), the Kuiper Belt
  Object that New Horizons flew by ([learn more](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Arrokoth/Arrokoth.php))
- 3D data giving **New Horizons' trajectory through the Solar System**
- **A 3D model of the New Horizons spacecraft**
- A **WWTL “layer file”** bundling all of this data for easy import into the WWT
  Windows client
- A **playable Guided Tour trailer** showing off all of these great new data
  sets (requires Windows client)
- A **tutorial** showing how you can recreate the tour trailer yourself
  (requires Windows client)

It's all available for free right here:

- [Watch the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1569bZ3i2UY)
- [Download the tour](https://bit.ly/WWT-PlutoPackTour) (10 MB; requires Windows client)
- [Download the data bundle](https://bit.ly/WWT-PlutoPackLayers) (10 MB; requires Windows client)
- [Read the tutorial](https://wwt-forum.org/t/recreating-the-pluto-pack-june-2020-tour-cinematic-effects-with-the-timeline-editor/143)

Keep your eyes peeled for the next content pack, and [get in
touch](mailto:wwt@aas.org) if there's a dataset that you'd love to see in WWT!


### New WWT User Website

The WWT “user” website — the basic informational pages about AAS WorldWide
Telescope — have gotten their first refresh in a long time. We're proud to
present our new look!

#### [Visit the new WWT website](https://www.worldwidetelescope.org/home/)

This update was made possible by technical improvements in our web
infrastructure that are unlocking a whole bunch of exciting changes to WWT's web
incarnations. Stay tuned!

As with everything we do, the source code to the website [is on
GitHub](https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/wwt-user-website) if you want to
see how it works under the hood or suggest an improvement.


### Absolute Reams of Revamped Documentation

When we started rebuilding the WWT website, we were reminded about the enormous
amount of documentation hidden away in corners of the old website. We dusted it
all off, upgraded the backing technology, and relaunched it all here:

### [Explore the new hub: docs.worldwidetelescope.org](https://docs.worldwidetelescope.org/)

Some of the text is a bit old, but there's a gold mine of material in there, and
more to come! Everything is written in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) and
hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/worldwide-telescope-docs-hub),
which are the main frameworks used for technical documentation these days — your
contributions are welcome!


### WWT Project Awarded National Science Foundation Grant

In some fantastic news for the project, the [American Astronomical
Society](https://aas.org/) (AAS) was awarded a three-year grant from the [US
National Science Foundation](https://nsf.gov/) to support the development of
capabilities for exploring the kinds of billion-pixel images that are going to
be produced every few minutes by new facilities like the [Rubin
Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/) (aka LSST). AAS Project Director Peter K. G.
Williams wrote about the grant and project plans
[here](https://aas.org/posts/news/2020/06/aas-worldwide-telescope-project-awarded-nsf-grant).

In order to build this new technology, the AAS will be looking for folks who are
excited to create modern systems for web-based astronomical data visualization!
[Reach out to the director](peter.williams@aas.org) if that could be you.


### Sneak Preview: Embed WWT Anywhere on the Web!

Finally, we have a sneak peek at a new project. We wrote above that WWT's
revamped web infrastructure is unlocking some big opportunities. One of these is
the possibility of embedding WorldWide Telescope in webpages the same way that
you might embed a YouTube video. We're prototyping not only an embed
application, but a new Embed Creator tool to make it easy to generate the HTML
code that you need. Take a look:

#### [Sneak peek: embed.worldwidetelescope.org](https://embed.worldwidetelescope.org/)

We don't have any documentation or tutorials yet, but those will be coming! The
development work is happening in [the wwt-webgl-engine
repository](https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/wwt-webgl-engine/) on GitHub.
